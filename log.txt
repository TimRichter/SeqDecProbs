2015-02-13: Patrik: 

  Added EmbProj which could be more handy for some finite sets (see
  comment in Finite.lidr).

2015-02-12: Patrik: Overview of the files and their imports 
  TODO: refactor the imports a bit more

  (While I was off-line a few other commits had solved most of the
  same issues as I did. But some new files were also added and this is
  now the new inventory.)

  No imports:
    Basics.lidr                    -- OK
    Prop.lidr                      -- OK
    Unique.lidr                    -- OK
    Decidable.lidr                 -- OK

  No local imports:
    Finite.lidr                    -- OK
    FinOperations.lidr             -- OK
    IsomorphismOperations.lidr     -- OK

  Almost no local imports:
    FinProperties.lidr             -- OK
    NatProperties.lidr             -- OK
    VectOperations.lidr            -- OK
    VectProperties.lidr            -- OK, but 1 unsolved meta

  Module name same as Finite.lidr: TODO
    finite.lidr                    -- OK, but finiteDecLemma complains about possible partiality

  Intermediate modules (more local dependencies):
    BoundedNat.lidr                -- OK, but 3 unsolved metas (2 SigmaProperties, 1 BoundedNat)
      import Basics, NatProperties, SigmaProperties, FinProperties, Finite

    FiniteOperations.lidr          -- OK
      import Finite, FinOperations, IsomorphismOperations
    FiniteProperties.lidr          -- OK, but 1 unsolved meta (from VectProperties)
      import Finite, FinOperations, IsomorphismOperations,    
                     FinProperties,
             FiniteOperations, 
             Prop, Decidable, 
             VectProperties

    SigmaOperations.lidr           -- OK
      import Finite, Decidable, Unique, FiniteOperations, VectOperations

    SigmaProperties.lidr           -- OK, but 2 unsolved metas
      import SigmaOperations, 
             Finite, Decidable, Unique, FiniteOperations, VectOperations

  Goals:
    tagging.lidr                   -- can't unify something with getW
    stochastic.lidr                -- OK, but 4 unsolved metas
    monadic.lidr                   -- OK, with _many_ unsolved metas

  Code from the Idris tutorial section of the paper:
    funprogintro.lidr              -- OK, but 3 unsolved metas

2015-02-12: Patrik: trying out the files

VectProperties.lidr  -- OK!
Basics.lidr          -- OK!
Decidable.lidr       -- OK!
FinProperties.lidr   -- OK!
finite.lidr          -- OK!
funprogintro.lidr    -- OK, with 3 unsolved metas

monadic.lidr         -- can't find Prop
NatProperties.lidr   -- can't find Prop
BoundedNat.lidr      -- can't find Prop
Finite.lidr          -- can't find Proposition
SigmaProperties.lidr -- can't find Unique
tagging.lidr         -- can't unify womething with getW

Checking recent commits: it looks like what was in Proposition should
now be (renamed and in) Unique. => SigmaProperties fixed.
And it looks like Prop is just Prop = Type.
This solves five out of six problems:
monadic.lidr         -- OK, with _many_ unsolved metas
NatProperties.lidr   -- OK
BoundedNat.lidr      -- OK (with 2 unsolved metas from Finite)
Finite.lidr          -- OK, with 2 unsolved metas
SigmaProperties.lidr -- OK

Left is:
tagging.lidr         -- can't unify womething with getW

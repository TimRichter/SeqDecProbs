NatProperties.lidr   -- can't find Prop
BoundedNat.lidr      -- can't find Prop
Finite.lidr          -- can't find Proposition
SigmaProperties.lidr -- can't find Unique
tagging.lidr         -- can't unify womething with getW

Checking recent commits: it looks like what was in Proposition should
now be (renamed and in) Unique. => SigmaProperties fixed.
And it looks like Prop is just Prop = Type.
This solves five out of six problems:
monadic.lidr         -- OK, with _many_ unsolved metas
NatProperties.lidr   -- OK
BoundedNat.lidr      -- OK (with 2 unsolved metas from Finite)
Finite.lidr          -- OK, with 2 unsolved metas
SigmaProperties.lidr -- OK

Left is:
tagging.lidr         -- can't unify womething with getW

Naming convention:
------------------

S11nn: the simplest case: deterministic, time-independent state

S12nn: deterministic, time-dependent

S13nn: monadic, time-dependent


Note:
-----

Not all files (are meant to) type check. Type checking certain files
yields very large *.ibc files or consumes huge computational
resources. In particular:

- S1106_Example2.lidr does not type check. This is an instance of a
  problem discussed in issue #79. This issue has been closed but, in my
  view, the problem is still open.

- S1206_Example3.lidr and S1206_Example4.lidr type check but yield *.ibc
  files which are about 1.5 GB each !

- Type checking of S1306_Example3.lidr and S1306_Example4.lidr
  stalls. After about 6 minutes the processes starts swapping memory
  after having consumed about 8GB of memory and produced .ibc files of
  about 500MB. CPU usage goes down to below 10% and type checking
  effectively stalls.

- Type checking of S1309_Example2.lidr and
  S1309_ClimateChangePolicyUnderTippingPointUncertainty.lidr also stalls
  (after about 10 minutes) but no .ibc files is produced.

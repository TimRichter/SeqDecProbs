# How to cope with cabal install problems (for Idris, but not Idris-specific)

Short: cabal unpack somelibrary; patch build-depends; cabal install somelibrary-v.v.v/; make

Background: I tried to install the latest github version of Idris to
benefit from some recent bugfixes to issues reported by Nicola
(generated from the SeqDecProb Idris code). The install gave an error
message from cabal (different from, but similar to, Error1 below).

## Step 1: I tried to remove and rebuild the sandbox:
``` Shell
cabal sandbox delete
cabal sandbox init
```

In this case, nothing much was improved.

## Step 2: Try on another system

I have ghc installed at home as well, so I tried to login remotely and
build there. The idea would be to build the binary and then copy that
file back. Didn't work.

## Step 3: Clean up and try again

I use mostly cabal sandboxes, but over time some packages have ended
up on the "user" level. I cleared this by
``` Shell
mkdir ~/oldhaskell
mv ~/.ghc ~/.cabal ~/oldhaskell
```
## Step 4: Try to actually solve the cabal constraint problem

Analysing Error1 (below).

* next goal: semigroupoids (dependency of reducers-3.10.3.1)
* rejecting: semigroupoids-5.0.0.2, 5.0.0.1, 5 (conflict: reducers => semigroupoids>=4 && <5)

Perhaps we can change reducers to accept the slightly newer semigroupoids?

``` Shell
cabal fetch reducers
```

This actually pulled in a long list of dependencies:
StateVar-1.1.0.0, adjunctions-4.2.1, bifunctors-5, comonad-4.2.6,
contravariant-1.3.1.1, data-default-class-0.0.1, distributive-0.4.4,
exceptions-0.8.0.2, fingertree-0.1.0.2, free-4.12.1, hashable-1.2.3.2,
kan-extensions-4.2.2, keys-3.10.2, nats-1, pointed-4.2.0.2,
prelude-extras-0.4, profunctors-5.1.1, reducers-3.10.3.1,
semigroupoids-4.3, semigroups-0.16.2.2, tagged-0.8.0.1,
transformers-compat-0.4.0.4, unordered-containers-0.2.5.1, void-0.7.

* Are they directory local? (No. No new directories appeared).
* Are they in the sandbox? (No. No new directories under .cabal-sandbox).
* They are user-local? (Yes. Found in ~/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org)

In particular reducers is in
  ~/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/reducers/3.10.3.1/reducers-3.10.3.1.tar.gz

### Step 4b

To get hold of the actual code we can unpack:
``` Shell
cabal unpack reducers
```

This command is directory-local (in contrast to fetch) so now we have
a source directory reducers-3.10.3.1/.

Let's try to relax the constraint on semigroupoids by editing line 36 in
```
    semigroupoids          >= 4        && < 5.1,
```

and then try to install this Idris-dependency (with its
dependencies). Note the final slash (/) tells cabal to install from
the local directory (which has been patched) and not from hackage
(which would fail).

``` Shell
cabal install reducers-3.10.3.1/
```

Success! Let's try Idris again then.

### Step 4c

``` Shell
make
```
Success!

Note: when using a sandbox, all packages are required to have consistent
dependencies. Try reinstalling/unregistering the offending packages or
recreating the sandbox.

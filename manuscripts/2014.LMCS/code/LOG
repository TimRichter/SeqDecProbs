2015-06-09: First LMCS revision round.

This is the outcome of the first revision round triggered by the LMCS
reviews. What we have done so far is some renaming

- |X| to |State|
- |Y| to |Ctrl|, |YV| to |GoodCtrl|
- |val|, |Val|, |MVal| to |value|, |val|, |Mval|
- ...

to comply with the reccomendations of Reviewer 1 and make sure that the
code type checks under 0.9.18.1-git:84bca25. This will allow us to refer
to this GitHub directory in the rebuttal and hopefully provide the
Editor with an additional argument for accepting the revised manuscript.

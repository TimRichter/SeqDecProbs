2015-07-24: DivMod:

  Botta:
   "to prepare for implementing non-negative rational numbers (and show that
    |SimpleProb| is a monad) I have played around with Melvar Chen's DivMod
    module (in contrib) and with the implementation of |gcd| from the
    prelude and tried to show that, if one divides two natural numbers by
    their greatest common divisor, the resulting pair is coprime. [...]
    any idea how to improve?"

  Patrik: I have a feeling the property should be proven by (an extended
    version of) the gcd algorithm, in much the same way as the DivMod is
    proven. Perhaps we could use Bézout's lemma?

    Bézout's Lemma: For every pair of whole numbers a and b there are
    two integers s and t such that a*s + b*t = gcd(a, b). And gcd(a, b)
    is the least positive integer representable in the form a*s + b*t.

  let  F a b d = "Exists s, t. a*s + b*t == d"
       Gcd a b = Least (F a b)
       Least P = Exists n. P n && Forall m. P m -> n <= m
  then gcd(a,b) = fst (Gcd a b)
  (or something like that)

2015-04-29: Patrik: Current status

  One missing metavariable when loading SeqDecProbMonadicExample2.lidr:
    VectProperties.injectiveFilterLemma
  Call chain? (what part of the proof depends on this?):
    (Unclear - the lemma is never used.)

  New try:
    make run
    # (compiles ~/src/ext/SeqDecProbs/SeqDecProbMonadicTheoryExample2.lidr)
patrikj@etyd:~/src/ext/SeqDecProbs$ make
idris -p contrib -p effects SeqDecProbMonadicTheoryExample2.lidr -o example
There are undefined metavariables: [SeqDecProbMonadicTheory.tabOptExt,SeqDecProbMonadicTheory.fX,VectProperties.injectiveFilterLemma]
  Fixed those (by commenting them out).
  Now the example runs.
  (But the theory has at least one hole.)

2015-03-05: Patrik: Left to do

  Problems in SeqDecProbMonadicExample2.lidr:

  The current formalisation of max and argmax are parametrised on an
  arbitrary function (f : A -> B) into a preorder B.

  The actual use of this is to choose a "control" of type (Y t x) for
  which a certain function is maximal. The actual type of the function
  to be maximised is from a subset of (Y t x) implemented as a Sigma
  type (Sigma (Y t x) (\ y => All (Viable {t = S t} n) (step t x y))).
  The details are not important, but what is important is that the
  type is of the form (Sigma A P) where P is a predicate intended to
  "carve out" the subset of controls which lead to viable next states.

  The function being optimized takes a value (y ** av) where y is used
  to compute a value and av is used to compute "certificates" needed
  to be allowed to call some functions needed to compute the value.

  My hypothesis is that what we need to proceed is a proof that the
  second component does not change the value of this function. This
  should be possible to formulate as (TODO: better name;-)

  Nice : {A : Type} -> {P : A -> Prop} -> (f : Sigma A P -> float) -> Prop
  Nice f = (y : A) -> (av : P y) -> (av' : P y) -> (f (y ** av) = f (y ** av'))

  The proof may be awkward but I think something of this king is
  needed instead of the (too strong) requirement Unique1 P.

  The function used for the optimization (in SeqDecProbMonadic.lidr)
  is built using the helpers mkg, mkf and val.

2015-02-12: Patrik: Overview of the files and their imports
  TODO: refactor the imports a bit more

  (While I was off-line a few other commits had solved most of the
  same issues as I did. But some new files were also added and this is
  now the new inventory.)

  No imports:
    Basics.lidr                    -- OK
    Prop.lidr                      -- OK
    Unique.lidr                    -- OK
    Decidable.lidr                 -- OK

  No local imports:
    Finite.lidr                    -- OK
    FinOperations.lidr             -- OK
    IsomorphismOperations.lidr     -- OK

  Almost no local imports:
    FinProperties.lidr             -- OK
    NatProperties.lidr             -- OK
    VectOperations.lidr            -- OK
    VectProperties.lidr            -- OK, but 1 unsolved meta

  Module name same as Finite.lidr: TODO
    finite.lidr                    -- OK, but finiteDecLemma complains about possible partiality

  Intermediate modules (more local dependencies):
    BoundedNat.lidr                -- OK, but 3 unsolved metas (2 SigmaProperties, 1 BoundedNat)
      import Basics, NatProperties, SigmaProperties, FinProperties, Finite

    FiniteOperations.lidr          -- OK
      import Finite, FinOperations, IsomorphismOperations
    FiniteProperties.lidr          -- OK, but 1 unsolved meta (from VectProperties)
      import Finite, FinOperations, IsomorphismOperations,
                     FinProperties,
             FiniteOperations,
             Prop, Decidable,
             VectProperties

    SigmaOperations.lidr           -- OK
      import Finite, Decidable, Unique, FiniteOperations, VectOperations

    SigmaProperties.lidr           -- OK, but 2 unsolved metas
      import SigmaOperations,
             Finite, Decidable, Unique, FiniteOperations, VectOperations

  Goals:
    tagging.lidr                   -- can't unify something with getW
    stochastic.lidr                -- OK, but 4 unsolved metas
    monadic.lidr                   -- OK, with _many_ unsolved metas

Decidable.lidr       -- OK!
FinProperties.lidr   -- OK!
finite.lidr          -- OK!

SigmaProperties.lidr -- can't find Unique
tagging.lidr         -- can't unify womething with getW

Checking recent commits: it looks like what was in Proposition should
now be (renamed and in) Unique. => SigmaProperties fixed.
And it looks like Prop is just Prop = Type.
This solves five out of six problems:
monadic.lidr         -- OK, with _many_ unsolved metas
NatProperties.lidr   -- OK
BoundedNat.lidr      -- OK (with 2 unsolved metas from Finite)
Finite.lidr          -- OK, with 2 unsolved metas
SigmaProperties.lidr -- OK

Left is:
tagging.lidr         -- can't unify womething with getW

- Implement a version of DP with time dependent state (and controls,
  transition and reward function) but without notions of reachability
  and viability.

- Setup an example (e.g., with a barrier) for which such approach is not
  feasible. 

- Move to the time dependent case with reachability and viability
  constraints. 

- Think about how the notions of viability and reachability can be
  extended to the general case !
